SVG is embedded in html so as to allow javascript to set corect initial position according to system time.

As of time of writing, *updating* the time from Javascript lead to a jerky, slow mess, so instead this example relies on svg animations for keeping the clock up to date... closer to a mechanical clock. One can, of course, re-syng it to the system clock my calling the time set function again.

Clock is also viewable at
